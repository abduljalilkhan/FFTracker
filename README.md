# Family & Friend Tracker App - Design Patterns and Technologies

## Important Note

Due to the proprietary nature of my previous work at a software house, some classes and data have been omitted from this project. This repository is intended to illustrate my coding practices rather
than serve as a complete application.

## Overview

This project demonstrates my coding style and architectural approach. It is designed to showcase my implementation of various patterns and best practices in Android development, 
specifically using Java and Kotlin.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to provide potential employers and collaborators with insight into my coding style, particularly in relation to:

## Design Patterns Used
## MVVM Architecture:(see "tracker" package in app)
The Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture is implemented to separate concerns, facilitating easier testing and maintenance. The ViewModel handles the presentation logic, while the View observes changes in the data.
## Repository Pattern:
The Repository pattern is used to abstract data sources and manage data operations. This ensures a clean separation between the data layer and the rest of the application, making it easier to manage and test.
## Coroutines:
Kotlin Coroutines are utilized for asynchronous programming, allowing smooth and efficient handling of background tasks such as location updates and API calls without blocking the main thread.
## Data Binding:
Data Binding is implemented to bind UI components directly to data sources, reducing boilerplate code and enhancing the responsiveness of the application.
## Singleton 
## Dependency Injection
## Firebase · Retrofit · Volley · REST APIs 

## Technical Stack
## APIs: Google Maps API, Geolocation API
## Real-time Updates: Web service implementation for real-time location tracking and notifications

## Impact
This project not only showcases technical proficiency in mobile app development but also emphasizes the importance of user-centric design and real-time data processing.

## Features
Av Tracker is a comprehensive family safety application focused on real-time location sharing and family monitoring. It leverages modern design patterns and technologies to ensure a robust
and user-friendly experience.
